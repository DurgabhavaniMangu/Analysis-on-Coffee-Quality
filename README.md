# ☕ Coffee Quality Analysis Using Power BI

## 📌 Overview

This project explores global coffee quality data to uncover the key factors that influence a high-quality cup of coffee. Using Power BI, I analyzed various attributes such as country of origin, bean variety, defects, color, and processing methods to generate actionable insights. The project involved data cleaning, dashboard creation, and insight extraction.

## 🛠 Tools Used

- **Power BI** – for data visualization and dashboarding  
- **Excel** – for data cleaning and preprocessing  
- **DAX** – to create custom measures and KPIs  

## 📊 Key Insights

- **Top-Scoring Countries:** Ethiopia, Tanzania, and Guatemala consistently produce the highest-quality beans.
- **Bean Color Matters:** Brown or yellowish-colored beans tend to have the highest quality scores.
- **Defect Patterns:**
  - Cattura and Catuai varieties have the **highest Category 2 defect counts**.
  - Coffee beans from **Guatemala, Taiwan, and El Salvador** also show high defect rates.
  - The **Ethiopian Heirloom variety** from Ethiopia has high Category 2 defects, while **Gesha** and **Walishalo** are the top-quality Ethiopian varieties.
- **Popular Processing Methods:** Washed (wet), natural (dry), and pulped natural are the most commonly used across all varieties.
- **High-Scoring Rare Methods:**
  - *Double Anaerobic* (used in Castillo)  
  - *Semi-Washed* (used in Java)  
  - *Honey Mostto* (used in Red Bourbon)  
  These methods produce excellent results in terms of aroma, flavor balance, and aftertaste, although they are less commonly used and have higher moisture levels.
- **Production Hotspot:** Nearly **80%** of the dataset’s coffee comes from **Ethiopia**.

## 💡 Takeaways

- When selecting coffee, **pay close attention to the processing method**, as it significantly impacts taste, aroma, and overall quality.
- **Rare methods** like Double Anaerobic, Semi-Washed, and Honey Mostto—although underused—can yield **exceptional quality**, especially when paired with specific bean varieties.
- **Beans from Guatemala, Taiwan, and El Salvador** tend to have **higher defect levels**, signaling potential quality concerns.
- **Gesha** and **Walishalo** from Ethiopia are outstanding in quality, while **Ethiopian Heirloom** shows higher defect levels despite its popularity.
